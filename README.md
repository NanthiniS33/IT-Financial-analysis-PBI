# 💼 IT Financial Expenditure Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📊 Overview

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of **IT expenditure** across multiple **business areas**, **regions**, and **cost categories**. The dashboard offers an interactive interface to monitor and compare **actual vs. forecasted vs. planned IT costs**, with an emphasis on **budget variance**, **cost efficiency**, and **strategic financial alignment**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how IT costs are distributed across functions, geographies, and cost elements.
- Identify variances between actual, forecast, and plan to flag overspending or underutilization.
- Analyze cost drivers such as internal labor, shared services, and IT planning.
- Enable decision-makers to perform drilldowns by department or cost category.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Excel** (as the data source)
- **DAX** (for calculations and measures)

## 🧩 Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

- Loaded dataset from Excel into Power BI.
- Cleaned and standardized field names.
- Handled missing values in actuals, forecasts, and plan columns.
- Categorized and formatted key dimensions (e.g., Region, IT Area, Cost Group).

### 2. Cost & Variance Analysis

- Calculated actual, forecasted, and planned IT spend.
- Derived variance measures (Actual vs. Plan, Forecast vs. Plan).
- Performed time-based analysis and cross-sectional comparison by business units.

### 3. Drilldown Features

- Segmented data by:
  - IT Area (Infrastructure, Applications, etc.)
  - Business Area
  - Cost Element Group (Labor, Shared Services, etc.)
- Identified top/bottom departments or regions in terms of budget performance.
- Compared cost patterns between internal and outsourced services.

### 4. Dashboard Design

- **Slicers** for Region, Department, and Month.
- **Bar/Column Charts** to highlight cost trends and variances.
- **KPIs & Cards** to show high-level financial performance.
- **Treemaps / Pie Charts** to break down cost composition by subgroup.

## 🚀 Key Insights

- Visibility into IT budget alignment across regions.
- Clear identification of over-budget and underutilized cost centers.
- Improved financial planning through trend-based forecasting comparisons.
